# CHANGELOG
## v3.2
#### This is such a HUGE update that I couldn't list every single change but these are some of the big ones.
* ***The options have been changed a lot so they may not all transfer over. Make sure to double check them.***
### Added
* Added slash command to test the loot filter.
* Added a warning on first run to disable other auto looting options.
* Added an option to select which chat frame to output Announce and other info to.
* Added 2 fonts to use.
* Added option to disable auto looting when Master Loot is active. *(still loots gold and currency, this options will change as its use is evaluated and feedback is recieved)*
* Added new Toast options. *(appearance, delay, padding, font)*
### Fixed
* Value Threshold money inputs are pretty and better.
* Loot Monitor Anchor now saves its position.
* Loot Filters are more accurate.
* Switched to new custom Constants system for item typing.
* Loot Filters no longer depend on translations. *(should work in any language!)*
* Switched from themed toasts to completely custom appearance options.
